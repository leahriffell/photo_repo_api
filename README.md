This [GraphQL on Rails API](https://photo-repo-api.herokuapp.com/graphql) serves queries and mutations for Virtual Escape, an application that allows you to travel in covid-safe style from your couch (or, let's be real, bed). There's a whole world out there so put on your best sweats amd come TFH (travel from home)!

I created this API for my application to Shopify's Backend Engineering Internship program. This is an API only (no user interface) but I plan on building out a separate frontend.
